(A) make the following objects. Are they immutable , are they ordered sequences i.e can you index them.
1- lists
2-dictionary


(B) operations
1- modulus
2- floor
3- average
4- 4.45e8 = what base 10
5-
(C) What are the data types in PYTHON
1- int , float , bool, string
2- how you check data type

(D) list the keywords in PYTHON
False, None , True , and , as , assert, break, class , continue , def, del, elif,
else, except, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is , lambda, nonlocal,
not, or, pass, raise, return, try, while, with, yield.
(E) Strings
1- Have print stmt print Phoenix's
(F) LISTS
1- len() , max(), min(), sorted()
2- new_str = "\n".join(["fore","aft", "starboard", "port"])
3- letters = ['a','b','c','d']
letters.append('z')
list methods
arr = [1,2,3]
1) arr.append(9) # add a single element to the end of list
2) arr.extend([10,11]) # merges another list L to the end
3) arr.insert(i,x)  # at position i insert element x. insert does NOT overwrite,
# it shift and existing values with same index to the right
4) remove(x)  # remove the first occurence of element x
5) pop() # removes the last element of a list, if an arg is passed, that index
item is passed out
6) index(x)  # returns the first value of an index in a list
7) count(x) # counts the number of occurences of an element x
8) sort() # sort the list
9) reverse() # reverse the list
(G) SETS
1- methods: add, pop
2- set used to remove duplicates from a list
numbers = [1,2,6,3,1,1,6]
unique_nums = set(numbers)
{1,2,3,6}
(H) DICTIONARIES
1- get method looks up values in the dictionary, but unlike square brackets, get
returns None if the key isn't found.

SOLUTIONS
(B)
1 - mod % (the remainder after dividing)
2- floor //  divides and rounds down to the nearest integer
3-
4- 4.445*10**8
5-
(C)
print(type(x))
(D)

(E)
1= print('Phoenix\'s')
